## Detailed Slide Outline (20 Slides)

### Section 1: Introduction (Slides 1-3)
**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Title:** I Built a Programming Language.
*   **Subtitle:** The Story of Beacon (BPL)

**Slide 2: About the Creator**
*   **Content:** A quick intro about me (Aaditya) and my passion for technology and solving problems.

**Slide 3: The Big Announcement**
*   **Content:** After months of work, design, and coding, I am officially releasing **Beacon v2.0.0**. This isn't just an app; it's the foundation other apps are built on.

### Section 2: The Logic "Why?" (Slides 4-6)
**Slide 4: The Problem with Coding**
*   **Content:** Show complex, messy code (C++ or Java). Explain that for beginners, this looks like alien hieroglyphics.

**Slide 5: My Vision**
*   **Content:** I wanted a language that reads like a story. Simple. Logical. English-like.

**Slide 6: What is a "Language"?**
*   **Explanation:** Just like French or Spanish communicates with people, a programming language communicates with machines. I built a better translator.

### Section 3: Introducing Beacon (Slides 7-9)
**Slide 7: Why "Beacon"?**
*   **Meaning:** A light that guides ships. This language guides the computer through logic clearly and safely.

**Slide 8: Core Philosophy**
*   **Quote:** "Code should be for humans first, machines second."
*   **Key Pillars:** Readability, Simplicity, Speed.

**Slide 9: Beacon vs The World**
*   **Comparison:** 
    *   Python: Easy but slow.
    *   C: Fast but hard.
    *   **Beacon:** The best of both worlds.

### Section 4: Under the Hood (Slides 10-13)
**Slide 10: How It Works (The Architecture)**

*   **Simple text:** It takes text files and turns them into actions.

**Slide 11: The "Brain" (Compiler)**
*   **Content:** I wrote a custom "Compiler" that understands grammar, rules, and logic. It catches errors before they happen.

**Slide 12: Powered by C**
*   **Technical Flex:** The engine running underneath is written in C, one of the fastest languages in existence. This makes Beacon incredibly efficient.

**Slide 13: Building from Scratch**
*   **Content:** I didn't use shortcuts. I built the syntax, the lists, the loops, and the memory management myself.

### Section 5: Features & Demo (Slides 14-17)
**Slide 14: Coding in English**
*   **Example:** 
    ```beacon
    traverse i from 1 to 10:
        show "Hello Family!"
    done
    ```
*   **Comment:** Look how readable that is!

**Slide 15: "Pack" Collections (New in v2.0)**
*   **Feature:** A new way to group items.
    ```beacon
    firm groceries = pack("Apples", "Milk", "Bread")
    ```

**Slide 16: Smart Type Detection**
*   **Feature:** Beacon knows if `42` is a number or if `"Hello"` is text automatically. The user doesn't have to worry about it.

**Slide 17: Performance**
*   **Content:** Because of the C engine, Beacon runs complex logic instantly.

### Section 6: Future & Conclusion (Slides 18-20)
**Slide 18: What's Next?**
*   **Roadmap:** Building a code editor, adding more math tools, and growing the capabilities.

**Slide 19: Live Demo**
*   **Action:** I will now show you how I write code in Beacon live on my laptop.


**Slide 20: Thank You**
*   **Content:** Thanks to my family/friends for supporting my long hours of coding.
*   **Footer:** Created with ❤️ by Aaditya.
