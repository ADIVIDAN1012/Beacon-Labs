# Beacon Programming Language

Welcome to the official repository for Beacon, a **user-oriented programming language** designed for clarity, simplicity, and intuitive coding. Beacon's core philosophy is Universal User-Oriented Programming (UOP), which prioritizes human-readable syntax and a natural logical flow over complex, machine-centric constructs.

This repository contains the complete documentation for the Beacon language, including its syntax, standard library, and core principles.

## About Beacon

Beacon was created to bridge the gap between human thought and code. It is designed for a wide range of usersâ€”from beginners and educators to experienced developers and domain experts.

### Core Philosophy
- **Human-Centric Syntax:** Keywords like `ask`, `show`, `check`, and `attempt` make code easy to read and write.
- **Intuitive Structure:** The language is structured to be predictable and easy to follow.
- **Clarity Over All:** Beacon's design emphasizes clear, self-documenting code.

## Key Features

- **User-Oriented Syntax:** A simple, expressive syntax based on the principles of UOP.
- **Modular by Design:** Organize code into reusable `toolkits`.
- **Clear Error Handling:** A straightforward `attempt-trap` system for managing errors.
- **Powerful Interfaces:** Use `bridge`s to define clean contracts between components.
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports classes (`blueprint`s), inheritance (`adopt`), and other OOP features.

## Getting Started

To get started with Beacon, we recommend reading the **[UOP Philosophy](./UOP.md)** to understand its core concepts, followed by the **[Syntax Reference](./Syntax.md)** to learn the basics of the language. The **[Code Examples](./Examples.md)** are a great resource for seeing the language in action.
