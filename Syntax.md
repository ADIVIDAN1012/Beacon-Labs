# Beacon Programming Language â€” Syntax

## Variable Assignment


var = 10
name = ask("Enter your name: ")
flag = off    <false boolean value>


---

## Data Types and Conversions

- Dynamic typing like Python
- Use convert variable to DataType for type conversion


Integer = convert val to num
flt = convert val to decim
txt = convert val to text
bitflag = convert val to bit


---

## Input / Output


name = ask("Enter your name: ")
show("Hello, {name}")
show("Welcome!")   <works without variables too>


> Beacon supports embedded variables in strings using {} syntax similar to Python f-strings but **without needing the f"" prefix**.

---

## Functions

- Define functions using spec
- Use funcall to call functions (optional for simple calls, recommended for clarity on complex calls)
- Use forward to return values


spec greet():
    show("Hello World")

funcall greet()

spec add(a, b):
    forward a + b

result = funcall add(5, 3)
show("Sum is {result}")


---

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements


check x > 10:
    show("Greater than 10")
alter x == 10:
    show("Equal to 10")
altern:
    show("Less than 10")


### Loops

- Use until instead of while


i = 0
until i > 10:
    show("Count {i}")
    i = i + 1


- Use traverse keyword from start to end instead of for


traverse i from 1 to 5:
    show("Number {i}")


---

## Error Handling


attempt:
    <risky code here>
trap ErrorType as e:
    show("Error occurred: {e}")
conclude:
    show("This runs always")

## Notes

- Assignment uses =, not a keyword.
- Dynamic typing means no need for explicit variable declaration keywords.
- String interpolation uses {} without f"".
- Use funcall optionally for clarity in function calls.
- convert variable to Type is the syntax for type conversion.
- Keywords have unique synonyms to avoid clashes and keep language clean.
