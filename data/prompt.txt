I need help designing a modern, professional website for my programming language project to deploy on GitHub Pages.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project Name: Beacon Programming Language (BPL)
- Version: v1.0.0
- Repository: https://github.com/ADIVIDAN1012/Beacon-Labs
- Target URL: https://adividan1012.github.io/Beacon-Labs/

WHAT IS BEACON:
Beacon (BPL) is a modern programming language with a dual-mode toolchain:
1. Compile Mode: Compiles BPL code to C for maximum performance
2. Run Mode: Direct AST interpretation for immediate execution without compilation
- Control flow (check/otherwise, traverse, until loops)
- Function declarations and calls
- Built-in functions (display, input, length, etc.)
- VS Code extension with syntax highlighting

WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS:

DESIGN AESTHETIC:
- Modern, premium, "Beaconic" theme (vibrant, dynamic, eye-catching)
- Dark mode with vibrant accent colors (avoid plain colors)
- Glassmorphism effects and smooth gradients
- Micro-animations and hover effects
- Professional typography (Google Fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Outfit)
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

SECTIONS NEEDED:
1. Hero Section - Eye-catching headline, tagline, CTA buttons
2. Features Section - Highlight dual-mode execution, syntax, VS Code integration
3. Code Examples - Interactive or syntax-highlighted BPL code samples
4. Download Section - Links to BPL.exe and VS Code extension
5. Quick Start Guide - Simple getting started instructions
6. Footer - GitHub link, contact info, version number

DOWNLOAD LINKS:
- BPL.exe: https://github.com/ADIVIDAN1012/Beacon-Labs/releases/download/v1.0.0/BPL.exe
- VS Code Extension: https://github.com/ADIVIDAN1012/Beacon-Labs/releases/download/v1.0.0/beacon-0.0.3.vsix

PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Website content suggestions (headlines, taglines, feature descriptions)
2. Color palette recommendations (vibrant, modern, Beaconic theme)
3. Layout structure and section organization
4. Code example suggestions (what BPL code to showcase)
5. Call-to-action text for download buttons
6. Any additional sections that would make the website compelling

TONE: Exciting, modern, innovative but professional. This should WOW visitors and make them want to try Beacon.

TARGET AUDIENCE: Developers interested in new programming languages, students learning compiler design, hobbyists, and anyone curious about language development.

INSPIRATION: Think modern landing pages like rust-lang.org, go.dev, or kotlinlang.org - clean, professional, with great code examples and clear value propositions.
