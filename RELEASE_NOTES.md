# Release Notes - v2.0.0: Pack Collections & Unique Features

## 🎉 Major Update: Pack Collections and OOP Enhancements

Beacon v2.0.0 introduces powerful new features that make the language even more expressive and unique!

### ✨ What's New

**Pack Collections** 🎒
- New `pack(items)` syntax for creating data collections
- Support for mixed-type collections: `pack(1, "hello", On)`
- Clean string representation
- Runtime interpretation for flexible data handling

**Traverse Loops** 🔁
- New `traverse i from start to end` syntax
- Replaces legacy `each` and `..` conventions
- Cleaner, more English-like iteration

**Blueprint/Spawn OOP Improvements** 🏗️
- Added `spec` keyword for method declarations
- Added `prep` keyword for constructors (alongside `make`)
- Enhanced parser support for complex OOP structures

**Accurate Documentation** 📚
- Created comprehensive `comparison.md` comparing Beacon vs Java/C/Python
- Updated website with honest runtime description (C-powered JSON AST interpreter)
- Fixed all misleading dual-mode claims

### 🔧 Pack Collections Usage

```beacon
< Basic pack >
firm nums = pack(1, 2, 3)
show "Numbers: |nums|"

< Mixed types >
firm data = pack("hello", 42, On)

< Empty pack >
firm empty = pack()

< Pack with expressions >
firm calculated = pack(10 + 5, 20 * 2)
```

### 🔁 Traverse Loops

```beacon
traverse i from 1 to 5:
    show "Count: |i|"
done
```

### 📝 Blueprint/Spawn Enhancements

```beacon
blueprint Animal:
    has name
    has age
    
    prep (n, age_val):
        own~>name = n
        own~>age = age_val
    done
    
    spec speak:
        show "Animal speaks"
    done
done

firm dog = spawn Animal("Rex", 3)
```
